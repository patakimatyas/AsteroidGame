# Asteroid Game

A simple asteroid-avoidance game implemented in C#/.NET with shared game logic and three user interfaces: WinForms, WPF (MVVM), and Avalonia (cross-platform).  
Originally developed as a university project to explore desktop and cross-platform UI frameworks, the MVVM pattern, and good software architecture.
